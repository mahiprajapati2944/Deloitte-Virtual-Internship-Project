# Deloitte Virtual Internship Project 🚀

This repository contains the work completed as part of the **Deloitte Virtual Internship** program, focusing on two core tasks under the domains of **Data Visualization** and **Forensic Technology Analysis**.

---

## 📁 Project Overview

The internship project is centered around **Daikibo Industrials**, a company operating multiple factories globally. The main objective was to use data analytics and visualization to uncover operational inefficiencies and social issues within the organization.

## 📌 Tasks Completed

### ✅ **Task 1: Telemetry Analysis with Tableau**

**Objective**: Analyze machine telemetry data to identify the factory with the highest machine breakdowns and determine which machines failed the most in that location.

**Steps:**
- Loaded and cleaned telemetry data from a unified `JSON` file.
- Created a calculated field `Unhealthy` to measure potential downtime (10 minutes per unhealthy status).
- Built the following dashboards in **Tableau**:
  - **Down Time per Factory**
  - **Down Time per Device Type**
- Enabled interactivity by allowing factory-level filtering on device-level downtime.

**Outcome**:
- Identified the factory with the most downtime.
- Highlighted the top failing machine types in that factory.

### ✅ **Task 2: Forensic Technology - Gender Pay Equality**

**Objective**: Investigate internal salary inequality using provided compensation scores.

**Steps:**
- Loaded `Equality Table.xlsx` containing factory, job role, and equality score.
- Created a new column `Equality Class` to classify scores based on fairness:
  - `Fair` → Score between -10 to +10
  - `Unfair` → Score between -20 to -11 or 11 to 20
  - `Highly Discriminative` → Score < -20 or > 20
- Used Excel formula to automate classification.

**Outcome**:
- Delivered a clear classification of roles and locations based on gender equality.
- Highlighted areas with the highest inequality for potential HR action.
